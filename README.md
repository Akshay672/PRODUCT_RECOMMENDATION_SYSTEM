### Types of recommendation system

## There are majorly six types of recommender systems which work primarily in the Media and Entertainment industry::

### 2. Content-based recommendation system
### 3. Collaborative recommendation system
### 4. Matrix factorization recommendation system
### 5. Association Rule
### 6. Hybrid-recommendation system

## 1. Popularity based recommendation system

### This model is not actually personalized - it simply recommends to a user the most popular items that the user has not previously consumed i.e. even though you know the behaviour of the user you cannot recommend items accordingly.

## 2. Content-based recommendation system

### This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended..
